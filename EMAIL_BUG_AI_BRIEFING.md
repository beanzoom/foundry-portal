## Summary of What Fixed

### The Problem
Integration tests were publishing events/surveys to production database, triggering email notifications to ALL portal users. Test cleanup failed on Oct 21, leaving queued emails in database. On Oct 22, creating a referral triggered the email processor, which sent the old test emails.

### The Fix

**1. Integration Tests** (2 files modified)
- [tests/integration/portal/portal-events.test.ts](tests/integration/portal/portal-events.test.ts)
- [tests/integration/portal/portal-surveys.test.ts](tests/integration/portal/portal-surveys.test.ts)

**Changes**:
- Tests use Pattern 1 (no email trigger) OR Pattern 2 (queue→validate→delete)
- NO tests publish without cleaning up queued emails
- Emails only queued to `portal@fleetdrms.com` (not all users)
- Queued emails DELETED before test ends

**2. Email Policy** (1 new file)
- [tests/integration/INTEGRATION_TEST_EMAIL_POLICY.md](tests/integration/INTEGRATION_TEST_EMAIL_POLICY.md)

**Establishes**:
- Policy: Integration tests SHALL NEVER send production emails
- Two approved patterns for testing
- Code review checklist
- Technical details of how trigger works

**3. Cleanup Migration** (1 new file)
- [database/migrations/005_complete_email_system_cleanup_and_validation.sql](database/migrations/005_complete_email_system_cleanup_and_validation.sql)

**Does**:
- Deletes ALL queued emails (fresh start)
- Deletes test notification rules
- Deletes test email templates
- Deletes test notification events
- Validates system is clean

**4. Documentation** (2 new files)
- [database/debug/EMAIL_QUEUE_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md](database/debug/EMAIL_QUEUE_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md) - Complete analysis
- [database/debug/EMAIL_BUG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](database/debug/EMAIL_BUG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - AI-focused summary

**5. Validation Plan** (1 new file)
- [database/VALIDATION_TEST_PLAN.md](database/VALIDATION_TEST_PLAN.md)

**Provides**:
- Step-by-step validation tests
- Expected results for each test
- Queries to run for verification

   - Test cleanup failed → emails remained

3. **Fixed integration tests**
   - Modified portal-events.test.ts
   - Modified portal-surveys.test.ts
   - Implemented Pattern 1 and Pattern 2

4. **Created documentation**
   - Email policy document
   - Root cause analysis
   - Quick reference for AI
   - Validation test plan

5. **Created cleanup migration**
   - Migration 005 to purge all test/queued emails

## How It Should Work Moving Forward

### Integration Tests

**Pattern 1 - No Email Trigger** (most tests):
```typescript
// Create content with status='draft' → NO emails queued
const { data } = await adminClient.from('portal_events').insert({
  title: 'Test Event',
  status: 'draft',  // ← DRAFT = no trigger
  is_active: false
});
```

**Pattern 2 - Queue + Validate + Delete** (email system tests):
```typescript
// 1. Publish (queues to portal@fleetdrms.com)
await adminClient.from('portal_events').update({
  status: 'published',
  published_at: new Date().toISOString()
}).eq('id', eventId);

// 2. Validate email queued
const { data: emails } = await adminClient
  .from('email_queue')
  .select('*')
  .eq('to_email', 'portal@fleetdrms.com');

// 3. CRITICAL: Delete before test ends
await adminClient.from('email_queue').delete().in('id', emails.map(e => e.id));
```

### Production Email System

**Referrals** (automatic):
- User creates referral
- Trigger fires instantly
- 2 emails queued (referee + admin)
- Email processor sends

**Events/Surveys/Updates** (admin controlled):
- Admin creates with `status='draft'`
- Admin clicks Publish
- Dialog shows recipient preview
- Admin confirms
- Trigger fires
- Emails queued to recipient list
- Email processor sends
