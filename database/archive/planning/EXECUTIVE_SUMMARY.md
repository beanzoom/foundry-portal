# Portal/App Separation - Executive Summary
## Complete Migration Plan Ready for Execution

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: üü¢ **READY TO EXECUTE**
**Completion**: Planning Phase 100% Complete

---

## üìã What We're Doing

**Goal**: Separate portal.fleetdrms.com from app.fleetdrms.com into two independent, autonomous systems.

**Current State**:
- One Supabase database containing BOTH portal and app data
- Shared authentication
- Monolithic codebase with mixed concerns
- Portal in PRODUCTION, App in DEVELOPMENT

**Target State**:
- Two separate Supabase projects (portal + app)
- Independent databases with clean separation
- Federated authentication (Option B1)
- Separate codebases
- Each system can evolve independently

---

## üéâ Major Discoveries

### 1. Users Already Separated ‚úÖ
- **9 portal users** (roles: portal_member, admin, super_admin, system_admin)
- **16 app users** (role: user)
- **ZERO overlap** - No user has both portal and app access
- Clean split possible without complex user migration logic

### 2. Migration Simpler Than Expected ‚úÖ
- **Original complexity estimate**: 8/10
- **Updated complexity estimate**: 6/10 (25% reduction!)
- **Reason**: Clean user separation, small data volume, well-organized code

### 3. Small Data Volume ‚úÖ
- Portal data: ~500 rows across 47 tables
- App data: ~400 rows across 27 tables
- **Data migration time**: 2-4 hours (not days!)
- Perfect timing - portal just started, minimal data to move

---

## üìä By The Numbers

**Database Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ 137 total tables analyzed
- ‚úÖ 47 tables moving to portal
- ‚úÖ 27 tables staying in app
- ‚úÖ 48 infrastructure tables (Supabase-managed, separate in each project)
- ‚úÖ 15 shared/split tables (mostly splitting profiles table)
- ‚úÖ 98 foreign key relationships mapped
- ‚úÖ 36 tables reference profiles (most critical dependency)

**Documentation**:
- ‚úÖ 771 markdown files cataloged
- ‚úÖ 12 database analysis queries executed
- ‚úÖ 402KB query results analyzed
- ‚úÖ 11 planning documents created (~150KB total)
- ‚úÖ 7 strategic decisions made
- ‚úÖ Complete migration roadmap documented

---

## ‚úÖ All Strategic Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Answer | Rationale |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | User account strategy | **Option B1** | Shared auth, separate profiles - future-proof |
| 2 | Email infrastructure | **Option A** | Portal owns, app builds own (future) - clean separation |
| 3 | Contact/CRM ownership | **Portal 100%** | DSP outreach is portal feature |
| 4 | Data migration scope | **Full migration** | All data is recent (portal is new) |
| 5 | Testing/rollback | **Blue-green** | Low traffic, easy rollback |
| 6 | Timeline | **Methodical** | No hard deadline, quality over speed |
| 7 | Budget | **No constraints** | Do it right |

## üéØ What Goes Where

### Portal Database Gets (47 tables):
- **All portal_* tables** (35): events, surveys, updates, referrals, memberships, admin activity, audit logs
- **Email system** (8 after consolidation): All email infrastructure, templates, notifications
- **Contact/CRM system** (9): contacts, DSPs, stations, markets, regions, interactions
- **Notification system** (4): notification_rules, events, recipient_lists, logs
- **Portal business** (4): businesses, membership_agreements, nda_agreements, calculator_submissions
- **Marketing** (3): referral conversions, campaign links, rate limits
- **Portal profiles**: 9 user profiles (portal roles)

### App Database Keeps (27 tables):
- **Fleet management** (7): fleet, maintenance_records, maintenance docs/notes/history
- **Driver/Scheduling** (6): driver_mappings, schedules, provider integrations
- **Permissions** (4): permissions, role_permissions, user_roles, audit log
- **Organizations** (2): organizations (fleet owners), organization_memberships
- **Modules** (2): app feature flags and configurations
- **System** (3): system_settings, system_user_assignments, wiki_articles
- **App profiles**: 16 user profiles (app users)

### Critical: What NOT to Migrate
See [planning/DO_NOT_MIGRATE.md](planning/DO_NOT_MIGRATE.md) for complete list.

**If you migrate fleet, maintenance_records, organizations, or permissions to portal, the app will break!**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. Email System Duplication
**Problem**: Email tables exist in BOTH public and portal schemas (8 + 4 tables)
**Cause**: Likely abandoned migration 042
**Solution**: Consolidate ALL email tables to portal schema
**Status**: ‚úÖ Plan approved (see EMAIL_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md)

### 2. Duplicate Foreign Key Constraints
**Problem**: Some tables have duplicate or conflicting FK constraints
- organizations.primary_contact (2 FKs with different delete rules)
- maintenance_records.vehicle_id (duplicate FK)
- maintenance_notes.maintenance_record_id (3 FKs!)

**Solution**: Fix before migration with SQL script
**Status**: ‚è≥ Script to be created

### 3. profiles Table Split
**Problem**: 25 users in one table, need to split to two databases
**Solution**: Split by role field (9 portal, 16 app)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Clean split possible (no overlap)

---

## üìÖ Timeline Estimate

**Total Duration**: 8-12 weeks (**UPDATED** - added security + testing requirements)

### Phase Breakdown:
1. ‚úÖ **Research & Planning** - COMPLETE (3 weeks)
2. ‚è≥ **Pre-Migration Validation** - User reviews checklist (1 week)
3. ‚è≥ **Duplicate FK Fixes** - Fix constraint conflicts (3-5 days)
4. ‚è≥ **üÜï Security DEFINER Fixes** - Add search_path protection (2-3 days) **NEW**
5. ‚è≥ **üÜï Basic Test Suite** - Critical path tests (1 week) **NEW**
6. ‚è≥ **Email Consolidation** - Merge email tables to portal schema (1-2 weeks)
7. ‚è≥ **New Portal Project Setup** - Create new Supabase project (1-2 days)
8. ‚è≥ **Data Migration** - Execute migration scripts (2-4 hours of execution, 1 week total)
9. ‚è≥ **Code Separation** - Update portal code to new database (1-2 weeks)
10. ‚è≥ **Documentation Migration** - Move portal docs (3-5 days)
11. ‚è≥ **Testing & Verification** - Run test suite + comprehensive testing (1-2 weeks)
12. ‚è≥ **Production Deployment** - Blue-green cutover (1 day execution, 1 week monitoring)

**Change from Original**: Added 1-2 weeks for security fixes + test creation (discovered by code analysis)
**Flexibility**: No hard deadline - proceed methodically, ensure quality

---

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### Approach: Blue-Green Deployment
1. **Build** new portal system (portal database + code)
2. **Test** thoroughly in staging
3. **Switch** traffic to new portal (instant cutover)
4. **Monitor** for 24-48 hours
5. **Rollback** if issues (keep old system running)
6. **Decommission** old portal after 1 week of stability

**Downtime**: Zero (blue-green cutover)
**Risk**: Low (small data, low traffic, easy rollback)

- 24-hour rollback window

### Risk 2: Breaking App Functionality
**Mitigation**:
- DO_NOT_MIGRATE.md lists all app tables
- Comprehensive testing of app after migration
- App functionality verified before portal cutover
- App tables NEVER leave current database

### Risk 3: Email System Failure
**Mitigation**:
- Email consolidation happens BEFORE portal separation
- Thorough email testing after consolidation
- Keep email backup tables for 30 days
- Monitor email sending closely

### Risk 4: Missing Dependency
**Mitigation**:
- 98 foreign keys mapped
- Migration order defined by FK dependencies
- Pre-migration checklist validates ALL dependencies
- Staging environment testing

### Risk 5: Storage File Loss
**Mitigation**:
- Inventory all storage files before migration
- Download all portal files
- Upload to new portal project
- Verify file access after migration
